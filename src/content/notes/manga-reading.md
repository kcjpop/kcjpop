_Keep track of manga I recently discovered and what the current story so far._

## 2025

### Boukyou Tarou

Art 3/5. Story 4/5.

Story about Taro Maizuru waking up after hibernation for 500 years to find out his wife and child were long dead and civilization has collapsed. Now he wants to go from Iran back to Japan.

## Dr. Kumahige

Art 4/5. Story 3/5

Dr. Kumahige opens a clinic in Shinjuku and the story revolves around his everyday life. The art is great but some chapters feel a bit dull. Kinda the same vibe with manga titles at that time.

## 2024

A nice, heart-warming story about a lost cat named Maruru and a stray cat named Hachi.

### Ryuu to Chameleon

Garyou Hanagami, a famous mangaka, and Shinobu Miyama, an assistant known for talent to copy other artists' style, swapped body in an accident. It's interesting to see how the story of this manga is developed.

### Kono Sekai wa Fukanzen Sugiru

_Quality Assurance in Another World_ is so good. It's about a QA named Haga got stuck in a VR game and he friended with an NPC named Nicola. The other QAs abuse the use of debugger mode to become gods in that game, while Haga only wants to logout. Current story: Haga and others are at a desert land, trying to cross the ocean.
